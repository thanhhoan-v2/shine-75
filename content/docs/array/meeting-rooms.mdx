title: Meeting Rooms
description: Given an array of meeting time intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], determine if a person could attend all meetings.

```js title="Example"
Input: intervals = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are overlapping intervals [0, 30] and [5, 10].

Input: intervals = [[7, 10], [2, 4]]
Output: true
Explanation: No overlapping intervals.
```

## Approach

1. **Sort Intervals**: Sort the intervals by start time.
2. **Check Overlaps**: Check if any interval overlaps with the next one.
3. **Overlap Condition**: If start time of current interval is less than end time of previous interval, there's an overlap.
4. **Return Result**: Return false if overlap found, true otherwise.
5. **Single Pass**: Use a single pass through the sorted array.

## Solution

- Time Complexity: `O(n log n)`
  > Where n is the number of intervals. We need to sort the intervals, which takes O(n log n).
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
  > We only use a constant amount of extra space for variables.

```js tab="JavaScript"
/**
 * @param {number[][]} intervals
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var canAttendMeetings = function(intervals) {
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
    
    for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        if (intervals[i][0] < intervals[i - 1][1]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
};
```

```java tab="Java"
class Solution {
    public boolean canAttendMeetings(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] < intervals[i - 1][1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```
