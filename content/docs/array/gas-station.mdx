title: Gas Station
description: There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i]. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations. Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

```js title="Example"
Input: gas = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], cost = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4.

Input: gas = [2, 3, 4], cost = [3, 4, 3]
Output: -1
Explanation: You can't start at any station and travel around the circuit once.
```

## Approach

1. **Check Total Gas vs Cost**: If total gas is less than total cost, it's impossible to complete the circuit.
2. **Start from Index 0**: Start from index 0 and track the current gas balance.
3. **Track Balance**: For each station, add gas and subtract cost to get net gain/loss.
4. **Reset on Negative**: If balance becomes negative, reset and start from next index.
5. **Return Valid Start**: If we can complete the circuit from a starting point, return that index.

## Solution

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
  > Where n is the length of the gas array. We iterate through the array once.
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
  > We only use a constant amount of extra space for variables.

```js tab="JavaScript"
/**
 * @param {number[]} gas
 * @param {number[]} cost
 * @return {number}
 */
var canCompleteCircuit = function(gas, cost) {
    let totalGas = 0;
    let totalCost = 0;
    let currentGas = 0;
    let startIndex = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
        totalGas += gas[i];
        totalCost += cost[i];
        currentGas += gas[i] - cost[i];
        
        if (currentGas < 0) {
            currentGas = 0;
            startIndex = i + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return totalGas >= totalCost ? startIndex : -1;
};
```

```java tab="Java"
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int totalGas = 0;
        int totalCost = 0;
        int currentGas = 0;
        int startIndex = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
            totalGas += gas[i];
            totalCost += cost[i];
            currentGas += gas[i] - cost[i];
            
            if (currentGas < 0) {
                currentGas = 0;
                startIndex = i + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return totalGas >= totalCost ? startIndex : -1;
    }
}
```
