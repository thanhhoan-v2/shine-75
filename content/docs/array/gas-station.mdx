title: Gas Station
description: There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i]. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations. Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

```js title="Example"
canCompleteCircuit([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]); // 3
canCompleteCircuit([2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 3]); // -1
canCompleteCircuit([5, 1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 4, 1, 5, 1]); // 4
```

## Approach

- If total gas is less than total cost, it's impossible to complete the circuit
- Start from index 0 and track the current gas balance
- If balance becomes negative, reset and start from next index
- If we can complete the circuit from a starting point, return that index

## Solution

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
  - We iterate through the array once, so the time complexity is O(n)
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
  - We only use a constant amount of extra space for variables

```js tab="JavaScript"
const canCompleteCircuit = (gas, cost) => {
  let totalGas = 0;
  let totalCost = 0;
  let currentGas = 0;
  let startIndex = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
    totalGas += gas[i];
    totalCost += cost[i];
    currentGas += gas[i] - cost[i];
    
    if (currentGas < 0) {
      currentGas = 0;
      startIndex = i + 1;
    }
  }
  
  return totalGas >= totalCost ? startIndex : -1;
};
```

```java tab="Java"
public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
    int totalGas = 0;
    int totalCost = 0;
    int currentGas = 0;
    int startIndex = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
        totalGas += gas[i];
        totalCost += cost[i];
        currentGas += gas[i] - cost[i];
        
        if (currentGas < 0) {
            currentGas = 0;
            startIndex = i + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return totalGas >= totalCost ? startIndex : -1;
}
```
