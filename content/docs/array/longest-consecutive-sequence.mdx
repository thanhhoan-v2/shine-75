title: Longest Consecutive Sequence
description: Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

```js title="Example"
longestConsecutive([100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]); // 4
longestConsecutive([0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]); // 9
longestConsecutive([1, 2, 0, 1]); // 3
```

## Approach

- Use a hash set to store all numbers for O(1) lookup
- For each number, check if it's the start of a sequence (no number-1 exists)
- If it's a start, count how many consecutive numbers follow
- Keep track of the maximum length found

## Solution

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
  - We iterate through the array once, and each number is checked at most twice
- Space Complexity: `O(n)`
  - We use a hash set to store all numbers, which can grow up to n elements

```js tab="JavaScript"
const longestConsecutive = (nums) => {
  const numSet = new Set(nums);
  let maxLength = 0;
  
  for (let num of numSet) {
    // Check if this is the start of a sequence
    if (!numSet.has(num - 1)) {
      let currentNum = num;
      let currentLength = 1;
      
      // Count consecutive numbers
      while (numSet.has(currentNum + 1)) {
        currentNum++;
        currentLength++;
      }
      
      maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
    }
  }
  
  return maxLength;
};
```

```java tab="Java"
public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
    Set<Integer> numSet = new HashSet<>();
    for (int num : nums) {
        numSet.add(num);
    }
    
    int maxLength = 0;
    
    for (int num : numSet) {
        // Check if this is the start of a sequence
        if (!numSet.contains(num - 1)) {
            int currentNum = num;
            int currentLength = 1;
            
            // Count consecutive numbers
            while (numSet.contains(currentNum + 1)) {
                currentNum++;
                currentLength++;
            }
            
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
        }
    }
    
    return maxLength;
}
```
