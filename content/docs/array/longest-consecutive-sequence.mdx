```js title="Example"
Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

Input: nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]
Output: 9
```

## Approach

1. **Hash Set**: Use a hash set to store all numbers for O(1) lookup.
2. **Check Sequence Start**: For each number, check if it's the start of a sequence (no number-1 exists).
3. **Count Consecutive**: If it's a start, count how many consecutive numbers follow.
4. **Track Maximum**: Keep track of the maximum length found.
5. **Avoid Redundant Checks**: Only check sequences from their starting points.

## Solution

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
  > Where n is the length of the array. We iterate through the array once, and each number is checked at most twice.
- Space Complexity: `O(n)`
  > We use a hash set to store all numbers, which can grow up to n elements.

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var longestConsecutive = function(nums) {
    const numSet = new Set(nums);
    let maxLength = 0;
    
    for (let num of numSet) {
        // Check if this is the start of a sequence
        if (!numSet.has(num - 1)) {
            let currentNum = num;
            let currentLength = 1;
            
            // Count consecutive numbers
            while (numSet.has(currentNum + 1)) {
                currentNum++;
                currentLength++;
            }
            
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
        }
    }
    
    return maxLength;
};
```

```java tab="Java"
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> numSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            numSet.add(num);
        }
        
        int maxLength = 0;
        
        for (int num : numSet) {
            // Check if this is the start of a sequence
            if (!numSet.contains(num - 1)) {
                int currentNum = num;
                int currentLength = 1;
                
                // Count consecutive numbers
                while (numSet.contains(currentNum + 1)) {
                    currentNum++;
                    currentLength++;
                }
                
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
            }
        }
        
        return maxLength;
