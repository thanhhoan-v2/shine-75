title: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
description: You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

```js title="Example"
Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.

Input: prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

## Approach

1. **Track Minimum Price**: Keep track of the minimum price seen so far.
2. **Calculate Potential Profit**: For each price, calculate the potential profit if we sell at the current price.
3. **Update Maximum Profit**: Update the maximum profit if the current profit is greater.
4. **Update Minimum Price**: Update the minimum price if the current price is smaller.
5. **Single Pass**: Use a single pass through the array to find the optimal solution.

## Solution

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
  > Where n is the length of the prices array. We iterate through the array once.
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
  > We only use a constant amount of extra space for variables.

```js tab="JavaScript"
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
    let minPrice = Infinity;
    let maxProfit = 0;
    
    for (let price of prices) {
        minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, price);
        maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, price - minPrice);
    }
    
    return maxProfit;
};
```

```java tab="Java"
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int minPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxProfit = 0;
        
        for (int price : prices) {
            minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, price);
            maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, price - minPrice);
        }
        
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
```
