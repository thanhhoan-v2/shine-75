title: Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
description: Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree. The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

```js title="Example"
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself.
```

## Approach

1. **Recursive DFS**: Use recursive depth-first search to find the LCA
2. **Base Cases**: If current node is null, p, or q, return the node
3. **Search Subtrees**: Recursively search left and right subtrees
4. **LCA Detection**: If both subtrees return non-null, current node is LCA
5. **Return Result**: Return the non-null result from subtrees

## Solution

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
  > Where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.
- Space Complexity: `O(h)`
  > The recursion stack depth is at most the height of the tree.

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @param {TreeNode} p
 * @param {TreeNode} q
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var lowestCommonAncestor = function(root, p, q) {
    if (root === null || root === p || root === q) {
        return root;
    }
    
    const left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
    const right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
    
    if (left !== null && right !== null) {
        return root;
    }
    
    return left !== null ? left : right;
};
```

```java tab="Java"
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (root == null || root == p || root == q) {
            return root;
        }
        
        TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        
        if (left != null && right != null) {
            return root;
        }
        
        return left != null ? left : right;
    }
}
