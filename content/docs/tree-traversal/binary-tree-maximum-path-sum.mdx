title: Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
description: A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root. The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path. Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

```js title="Example"
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
```

## Approach

1. **Recursive DFS**: Use recursive depth-first search to explore all paths
2. **Return Maximum Path**: For each node, return the maximum path sum that can be extended from this node
3. **Update Global Maximum**: Keep track of the global maximum path sum found so far
4. **Handle Negative Values**: Consider the case where a node has negative value
5. **Path Construction**: A path can go through the current node and extend to left and right subtrees

## Solution

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
  > Where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.
- Space Complexity: `O(h)`
  > The recursion stack depth is at most the height of the tree.

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxPathSum = function(root) {
    let maxSum = -Infinity;
    
    const dfs = (node) => {
        if (node === null) return 0;
        
        // Get maximum path sums from left and right subtrees
        const leftMax = Math.max(0, dfs(node.left));
        const rightMax = Math.max(0, dfs(node.right));
        
        // Update global maximum with path through current node
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, node.val + leftMax + rightMax);
        
        // Return maximum path that can be extended from this node
        return node.val + Math.max(leftMax, rightMax);
    };
    
    dfs(root);
    return maxSum;
};
```

```java tab="Java"
class Solution {
    private int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root);
        return maxSum;
    }
    
    private int dfs(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        
        // Get maximum path sums from left and right subtrees
        int leftMax = Math.max(0, dfs(node.left));
        int rightMax = Math.max(0, dfs(node.right));
        
        // Update global maximum with path through current node
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, node.val + leftMax + rightMax);
        
        // Return maximum path that can be extended from this node
        return node.val + Math.max(leftMax, rightMax);
    }
