```js title="Example"
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

## Approach

1. **Sliding Window**: Use a sliding window to maintain a substring without repeating characters.
2. **Hash Set/Map**: Use a hash set or map to track characters in the current window.
3. **Window Expansion**: Expand the window by adding new characters from the right.
4. **Window Contraction**: When a repeating character is found, contract the window from the left.
5. **Optimization**: Use a hash map to store the last position of each character for faster contraction.

## Solution

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
  > Where n is the length of the string. We traverse the string once with a sliding window.
- Space Complexity: `O(min(m, n))`
  > Where m is the size of the character set. We store at most min(m, n) characters in the hash set.

```js tab="JavaScript"
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {
    const charSet = new Set();
    let maxLength = 0;
    let left = 0;
    
    for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
        const rightChar = s[right];
        
        // If character is already in set, shrink window from left
        while (charSet.has(rightChar)) {
            charSet.delete(s[left]);
            left++;
        }
        
        // Add current character to set
        charSet.add(rightChar);
        
        // Update max length
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
    }
    
    return maxLength;
};
```

```java tab="Java"
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        Set<Character> charSet = new HashSet<>();
        int maxLength = 0;
        int left = 0;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
            char rightChar = s.charAt(right);
            
            // If character is already in set, shrink window from left
            while (charSet.contains(rightChar)) {
                charSet.remove(s.charAt(left));
                left++;
            }
            
            // Add current character to set
            charSet.add(rightChar);
            
            // Update max length
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
}
