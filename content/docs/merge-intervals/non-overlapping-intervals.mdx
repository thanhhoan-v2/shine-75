```js title="Example"
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest non-overlapping.

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

## Approach

1. **Sort by End Time**: Sort intervals by end time (ascending)
2. **Greedy Selection**: Keep intervals with earlier end times
3. **Track Last End**: Keep track of the end time of the last selected interval
4. **Count Removals**: Count intervals that need to be removed
5. **Return Result**: Return the count of removed intervals

## Solution

- Time Complexity: `O(n log n)`
  > We need to sort the intervals
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
  > We only use a constant amount of extra space

```js tab="JavaScript"
/**
 * @param {number[][]} intervals
 * @return {number}
 */
var eraseOverlapIntervals = function(intervals) {
    if (intervals.length <= 1) return 0;
    
    // Sort intervals by end time
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);
    
    let count = 0;
    let lastEnd = intervals[0][1];
    
    for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        if (intervals[i][0] < lastEnd) {
            // Overlapping interval, remove it
            count++;
        } else {
            // Non-overlapping interval, keep it
            lastEnd = intervals[i][1];
        }
    }
    
    return count;
};
```

```java tab="Java"
class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        if (intervals.length <= 1) return 0;
        
        // Sort intervals by end time
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);
        
        int count = 0;
        int lastEnd = intervals[0][1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] < lastEnd) {
                // Overlapping interval, remove it
                count++;
            } else {
                // Non-overlapping interval, keep it
                lastEnd = intervals[i][1];
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```
