title: Number of Islands
description: Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.

```js title="Example"
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

## Approach

1. **Depth-First Search**: Use DFS to explore connected land cells
2. **Grid Traversal**: Iterate through each cell in the grid
3. **Island Detection**: When a '1' is found, start DFS to mark all connected land
4. **Visited Marking**: Mark visited cells as '0' to avoid revisiting
5. **Count Islands**: Increment counter for each new island found
6. **Return Result**: Return the total number of islands

## Solution

- Time Complexity: `O(m*n)`
  > Where m and n are the dimensions of the grid
- Space Complexity: `O(m*n)`
  > In worst case, the recursion stack can be as deep as the grid size
