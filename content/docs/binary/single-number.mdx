```js title="Example"
Input: nums = [2, 2, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 appears only once, while 2 appears twice.

Input: nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
Output: 4
```

## Approach

1. **XOR Operation**: Use XOR (exclusive or) operation to find the single number.
2. **XOR Properties**: XOR has the following properties:
   - a ^ a = 0 (any number XORed with itself gives 0)
   - a ^ 0 = a (any number XORed with 0 gives itself)
   - a ^ b ^ a = b (XOR is associative and commutative)
3. **Initialize Result**: Start with result = 0.
4. **XOR All Numbers**: XOR all numbers in the array.
5. **Return Result**: The result will be the single number.

## Solution

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
  > Where n is the length of the array. We iterate through the array once.
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
  > We only use a constant amount of extra space for variables.

```js tab="JavaScript"
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var singleNumber = function(nums) {
    let result = 0;
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        result ^= num;
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

```java tab="Java"
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int result = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            result ^= num;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```
