```js title="Example"
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string has three '1' bits.

Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
```

## Approach

1. **Bit Manipulation**: Use bit manipulation to count 1 bits.
2. **Brian Kernighan's Algorithm**: Repeatedly clear the least significant 1 bit.
3. **Clear Least Significant 1**: Use n & (n - 1) to clear the least significant 1 bit.
4. **Count Iterations**: Count how many times we can clear a 1 bit.
5. **Return Count**: Return the count of 1 bits.

## Solution

- Time Complexity: `O(log n)`
  > Where n is the input number. The number of iterations equals the number of 1 bits.
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
  > We only use a constant amount of extra space for variables.

```js tab="JavaScript"
/**
 * @param {number} n - a positive integer
 * @return {number}
 */
var hammingWeight = function(n) {
    let count = 0;
    
    while (n !== 0) {
        n = n & (n - 1);
        count++;
    }
    
    return count;
};
```

```java tab="Java"
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        
        while (n != 0) {
            n = n & (n - 1);
            count++;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```
