title: Inorder Successor in BST
description: Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST. If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return null.

```js title="Example"
Input: root = [2, 1, 3], p = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor is 2.

Input: root = [5, 3, 6, 2, 4, null, null, 1], p = 6
Output: null
Explanation: 6 has no in-order successor.
```

## Approach

1. **Binary Search**: Use binary search to find the successor.
2. **Initialize Successor**: Set successor to null initially.
3. **Traverse Tree**: Start from root and traverse the tree.
4. **Compare Values**: If current node value > p value, update successor and go left.
5. **Go Right**: If current node value less than or equal to p value, go right.
6. **Return Successor**: Return the successor when traversal is complete.

## Solution

- Time Complexity: `O(h)`
  > Where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case, we traverse the height of the tree.
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
  > We only use a constant amount of extra space for variables.

```js tab="JavaScript"
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @param {TreeNode} p
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var inorderSuccessor = function(root, p) {
    let successor = null;
    let current = root;
    
    while (current !== null) {
        if (current.val > p.val) {
            successor = current;
            current = current.left;
        } else {
            current = current.right;
        }
    }
    
    return successor;
};
```

```java tab="Java"
class Solution {
    public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
        TreeNode successor = null;
        TreeNode current = root;
        
        while (current != null) {
            if (current.val > p.val) {
                successor = current;
                current = current.left;
            } else {
                current = current.right;
            }
        }
        
        return successor;
    }
}
```
