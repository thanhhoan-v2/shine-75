title: Climbing Stairs
description: You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

```js title="Example"
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

## Approach

1. **Base Cases**: If n â‰¤ 2, return n directly since there are n ways to climb n steps
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use a bottom-up approach with two variables to track previous two values
3. **Fibonacci Pattern**: The number of ways to reach step i is the sum of ways to reach step (i-1) and step (i-2)
4. **Iteration**: Iterate from 3 to n, updating the two variables at each step

## Solution

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
  > We iterate through each step from 3 to n once
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
  > We only use two variables regardless of input size

```js tab="JavaScript"
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var climbStairs = function(n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    
    let prev1 = 1, prev2 = 2;
    
    for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        let current = prev1 + prev2;
        prev1 = prev2;
        prev2 = current;
    }
    
    return prev2;
};
```

```java tab="Java"
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 2) return n;
        
        int prev1 = 1, prev2 = 2;
        
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            int current = prev1 + prev2;
            prev1 = prev2;
            prev2 = current;
        }
        
        return prev2;
    }
}
```
