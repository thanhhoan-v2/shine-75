title: Linked List Cycle
description: Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it. There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.

```js title="Example"
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

## Approach

1. **Floyd's Tortoise and Hare**: Use two pointers - slow and fast
2. **Initialize Pointers**: Set both pointers to the head of the list
3. **Move Pointers**: Move slow pointer by 1 step and fast pointer by 2 steps
4. **Cycle Detection**: If fast pointer reaches null, there's no cycle
5. **Meeting Point**: If slow and fast meet, there's a cycle

## Solution

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
  > Where n is the number of nodes in the linked list
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
  > We only use two pointers regardless of input size
